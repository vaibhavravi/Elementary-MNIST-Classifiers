# Classification of MNIST dataset using elementary classifiers
Uses the following classifiers to predict the handwritten digits of the MNIST dataset

1. Simple Linear Classifier
2. Feed Forward Neural Network using the ReLU non-linearity; max(0, x)
3. Feed Forward Neural Network using the Leaky ReLU non-linearity; max(0.01 * x, x)
4. Feed Forward Neural Network using the MaxOut non-linearity; max(x1, x2)
